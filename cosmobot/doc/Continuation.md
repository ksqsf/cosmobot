# Agent Continuations

## Motivation

Agent exploration is non-monotonic, while an LLM transcript normally grows
monotonically. A failed hypothesis may consume many tool calls and tokens, then
remain in every later model request even when only its conclusion matters.

Continuations give the agent an explicit context-backtracking boundary. The
agent captures its current model context, explores, and may later resume the
capture point with a compact JSON value. Messages produced by the abandoned
branch are removed from future model input.

However, this is only agent-level continuation. It does not undo file
or database writes, messages, resources, audit events, or output
already shown to the user.

## Tool Interface

### `capture_continuation`

Captures the current agent continuation. It must be the only tool call
in its model turn.

```json
{
  "label": "optional description"
}
```

The initial result is:

```json
{
  "state": "captured",
  "continuation_id": "call_123",
  "label": "optional description",
  "scope": "current_agent_run",
  "one_shot": true
}
```

If the continuation is later resumed, the agent instead observes this call as
returning:

```json
{
  "state": "resumed",
  "continuation_id": "call_123",
  "value": {
    "conclusion": "The parser hypothesis was false",
    "evidence": ["Parser.hs:42"]
  }
}
```

### `resume_continuation`

Non-locally resume a captured continuation with an arbitrary JSON
value. It must also be called alone.

```json
{
  "continuation_id": "call_123",
  "value": {
    "conclusion": "The parser hypothesis was false",
    "evidence": ["Parser.hs:42"]
  }
}
```

Continuations are one-shot and scoped to one agent run. They may be
nested.  Resuming a continuation consumes it and discards every
continuation captured inside its abandoned branch; older outer
continuations remain available.

## Expected Uses

- Test a hypothesis, then return only the conclusion and evidence.
- Explore a noisy log, search, or tool result without retaining the
  full path.
- Try nested alternatives and return to the appropriate decision
  point.
- Recover from a locally unproductive strategy without restarting the
  agent.

Continuations are less useful for ordinary linear work, irreversible
actions, or parallel delegation. Subagents and isolated workspaces
remain better fits for those cases.

## Implementation

The two tools are model-visible control forms interpreted by
`Bot.Agent.Middleware.Continuation`, rather than ordinary external
capabilities.

The middleware uses `aroundToolTurn`, where it can see both the pre-tool
`AgentState` and the assistant message containing the tool call. Captured
continuations live in the run-local transient HList state and contain:

- the assistant/tool-call transcript at the capture point;
- the original capture `ToolCall`;
- a monotonically increasing nesting ordinal.

The continuation ID is the original tool-call ID. On resume, the
middleware:

1. records the `resume_continuation` call through normal tool
   observation;
2. replaces the current transcript with the saved capture transcript;
3. appends a tool result to the original capture call containing the
   JSON value;
4. removes the resumed continuation and all newer nested
   continuations;
5. advances the current tool-turn counter instead of restoring the old
   counter.

The last rule prevents continuations from bypassing the agent
tool-turn limit.  A valid, sole `resume_continuation` may execute at
the limit so the agent can escape a branch and produce a final answer.

The middleware intercepts a continuation name only when that tool is
present in the run's exposed tools. Mixed continuation and sibling
tool calls are rejected as a group before any sibling executes. The
final conversation transcript contains only the selected logical
history, while the append-only agent audit retains the actual capture,
abandoned branch, and resume calls.

## Alternatives

### `setjmp` and `longjmp`

These names make the two-return behavior familiar, but also suggest restoration
of a machine stack or process state. Cosmobot restores only model context, so
`capture_continuation` and `resume_continuation` describe the boundary more
accurately.

### One `callcc` or `continuation` Tool

A single tool with an `op` field saves one schema but makes action
selection less explicit.  `callcc` also implies stronger semantics
such as ordinary continuation values and unrestricted multi-shot
invocation. The two verb-named tools expose exactly the supported
actions.

Also `callcc` is high-order and does not immediately translate to what
an agent expects.

### Subagents

Subagents provide clean context, concurrency, independent prompts, and
separate tool permissions. They return a result to the parent but do
not restore the parent agent's own earlier decision point. They are
preferable for delegation; continuations are preferable for local
backtracking.

### Session Forks and Transcript Compaction

Session forks preserve multiple durable branches for users to revisit.
Compaction summarizes old context. Neither provides an
agent-controlled, one-shot return from a speculative branch with an
explicit value.

## Related Work

[Context-Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967) is the closest prior work.
It gives an agent `branch` and `return` actions: the agent enters a temporary
sub-trajectory, then returns a summary while the intermediate branch is removed
from the main context. It establishes prior art for agent-controlled context
branching. Cosmobot is, to our knowledge, the first agent harness to expose
model-callable, opaque, one-shot continuation handles that support nested
capture and resume the original tool-call position with an arbitrary JSON
value. Unlike Context-Folding, it does not prescribe a subtask-and-summary
structure.

[LangGraph time travel](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/use-time-travel)
uses persisted checkpoints to replay or fork graph execution. It preserves the
original history and re-executes nodes after the selected checkpoint. Cosmobot's
continuation is run-local, model-invoked, and returns a value into the original
capture call instead of creating a durable graph branch.

[Claude Code checkpointing](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing)
can rewind conversation, code, or both, and can summarize one side of a chosen
checkpoint. It is user-operated and includes selected file restoration;
Cosmobot exposes transcript backtracking directly to the agent and deliberately
does not claim filesystem rollback.

[AutoGen agents](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html)
expose application-level `save_state` and `load_state` operations. These allow a
host to persist and restore agent state, but are not a model-callable
capture/resume pair with a returned JSON value.

[OpenAI Agents SDK sessions](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/sessions/)
support managed conversation history, removal of recent items, and compaction.
Those mechanisms manage history between runs; they do not implement local
non-local control flow inside an agent run.

The current design provides agent-level non-local return and backtracking. It
does not provide formal non-deterministic computation such as multi-shot choice
enumeration.

-- | Merge several streams into one stream through a bounded FIFO queue.

-- The @streaming-concurrency@ package provides @Streaming.Concurrent@ with a
-- similar @withMergedStreams@ helper, but its current Hackage release depends
-- on older @streaming-with@ / @streaming-bytestring@ bounds that do not solve
-- with this project's GHC 9.6 toolchain. Keep this small local version until
-- that dependency chain is usable here.
